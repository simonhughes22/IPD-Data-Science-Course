Go over lessons practicing DS learned from blog post notes.

Visualize the decision boundary changing as a perceptron learns. Show the data point examined and how it impacts the line visually (1D data)

Teach Linear Regression first, using the simple 1D formula. Talk about correlations and how you can’t learn a non-linear relationship with a single straight-line, but you can if you partition the x’s into regions -> Decision Trees. Then teach knn and Logistic Regression.


Talk about:

Correlation vs Causation. How to tease out cause from effect.
Controlled Experimentation.
Repeatable experiments (show PhD files).
Lessons learned in the field (blog post entry)
